Email Sending Module for Report Distribution (HTML Enhanced)

This module sends generated reports as email attachments with a polished,
responsive HTML email template, while also including a plain-text fallback.

Key Features:
    - HTML email body styled with CSS (external template)
    - Jinja2 templating for dynamic content injection
    - Secure SMTP connection with STARTTLS encryption
    - Multiple recipient support
    - PDF and JSON file attachment handling
    - Base64 encoding for binary attachments
    - Comprehensive error handling and logging
    - Environment variable configuration for security

Required Environment Variables:
    SMTP_HOST: SMTP server hostname (e.g., smtp.gmail.com)
    SMTP_PORT: SMTP server port (e.g., 587 for TLS)
    SMTP_USER: SMTP authentication username/email
    SMTP_PASS: SMTP authentication password/token

Security Notes:
    - Uses STARTTLS for encrypted connections
    - Credentials loaded from environment variables only
    - No credential storage in code or logs
    - Supports modern SMTP authentication methods

Dependencies:
    - smtplib: Built-in SMTP client
    - email.mime.*: Email message construction
    - dotenv: Environment variable management
    - jinja2 for HTML template rendering

    Attach a file to an email message as a binary attachment.
    
    This function handles the process of reading a file, encoding it as base64,
    and attaching it to an email message with proper MIME headers. It supports
    any file type by using the generic 'application/octet-stream' MIME type.
    
    Args:
        msg (MIMEMultipart): The email message object to attach the file to
        file_path (str): Full path to the file to be attached
    
    Returns:

        FileNotFoundError: If the specified file does not exist
        PermissionError: If the file cannot be read due to permissions
        OSError: If there are other file system errors during reading
    
    MIME Handling:
        - Uses 'application/octet-stream' for universal binary file support
        - Encodes file content as base64 for email transmission
        - Sets Content-Disposition header for proper client handling
        - Preserves original filename in the attachment
    
    Example:
        >>> msg = MIMEMultipart()

def _render_email_html(report_name: str, has_json: bool) -> str:
    """
    Render an HTML email body from a predefined template with dynamic report details.
    
    This function loads the `email-template.html` file from the project's `templates` 
    directory and injects dynamic values into placeholders to generate the final HTML 
    content for an email notification. It is primarily used to notify users about the 
    generation of a report, optionally including a JSON reference if available.
    
    Args:
        report_name (str): The name of the generated report (used in both subject and body)
        has_json (bool): Flag indicating if a JSON version of the report is available.
                        If True, the text "and JSON" will be appended to the report type.
    
    Returns:
        str: The fully rendered HTML string ready to be sent as an email body.
    
    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the `email-template.html` file cannot be found.
        TemplateError: If Jinja2 encounters an error while parsing or rendering the template.
    
    Template Variables:
        - subject: The subject line for the email (e.g., "Report: Artworks-2025-08-14")
        - report_name: The base name of the report
        - has_json: The string `" and JSON"` if a JSON file is included, otherwise `""`

    Notes:
        - Templates are stored in `src/templates/email-template.html` relative to this file.
